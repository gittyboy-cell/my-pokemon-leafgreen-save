this is my progress on pokemon leafgreen
This is usually updated every night.
When there is no commits for more than a night
There is two usual reasons
1. no progress
2. i forgot
3. it is not possible in the current state

included files are :
requirements.txt (requirements for running the game with the save,
the save file,
HOW-TO-USE.txt ( how to run the game with the save)
The game itself
